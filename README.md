# Taylor
Library to model mass transfer in Taylor flow columns
To calculate the column Kla use the function Kla(Us,Rc,D,Ls,Lb,rho,g,mu,sigma)
The input parameters are (all of them in units of the International System):
Us average fluid velocity in the duct
Rc Radius of the duct
D gas diffusivity coefficient in the liquid
Ls lenght of the liquid slugs
Lb length of the Taylor bubbles
rho density of the liquid
g acceleration of gravity
mu viscosity of the liquid
sigma surface tension of the liquid
